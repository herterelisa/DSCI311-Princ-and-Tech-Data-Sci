Intermediate and advanced techniques in data science. This course prepares students to successfully apply computational and statistical techniques to upper-division coursework in data science as well as quantitative, data-driven courses in other domains or subject areas. Topics include managing data with Python, including Pandas, data cleaning, handling text, dimensionality, principal components analysis, regression, classification, and inference. Ethical concerns resulting from use of the techniques in this course will be addressed. This course will culminate in the implementation of a student-led project employing the three objectives of data science: Exploration, Inference and Prediction.
